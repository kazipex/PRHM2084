                    <p>Earth remains humanity’s heart, both cradle and battlefield. Once the undisputed center of civilization, it now bears the scars of centuries of industry, war, and political division.</p>
                    <p>The planet’s landscapes are a patchwork of towering megacities, polluted wastelands, and fiercely protected preserves — reminders of what was lost and what survives. Beneath its crowded skies, the great powers maintain their grip through sprawling governments, corporate syndicates, and vast military infrastructures. Earth is not just a homeworld but a throne, the seat of authority from which all colonial ventures are judged and measured. Here, superpowers still dictate policy, corporations like Armatech build their fortunes, and every nation fights to prove it still matters in an age when the stars are no longer distant dreams but contested frontiers.</p>
