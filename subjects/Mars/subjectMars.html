                    <p class="subjectOpening">Mars stands as humanity’s boldest experiment in colonization. A world carved from dust and ambition, Mars is no longer the barren wasteland of legend.</p>
                    <p class="subjectContents">Terraforming has scarred the planet into something new — a world of relentless rains, choking jungles, and shifting deserts. Though its surface is vast and untamed, the first foundations of human industry have taken root: massive mining operations, processing plants, and fortified outposts, scattered like islands across an ocean of wilderness. Mars is not yet a colony, but a prize — an industrial zone claimed by Earth’s superpowers and their corporate allies. The United States and Russia wage shadow wars here, each seeking to control its resources, while Armatech, the weapons giant, supplies both sides and waits for the moment to find its true place in the solar system.</p>
